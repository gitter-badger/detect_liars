# Detect Liars
Detect Liars is a fingerprinting library developped in javascript. For better performance it must be used with a server side language to get information about the http headers sent by the client.

##Warning : This library is under development
With this library you can (or will be able to) get the fingerprint of a user :
  - navigator properties
  - browser
  - OS
  - list of fonts
  - canvas
  - webGl
  - and many other things
  - 

The strength of this library is that we don't consider informations sent by the users as reliable. We try to discover if there are inconsistencies. If it is the case, we try to discover the truth. To do that we use different kinds statistics on the fonts, plugins, screen dimensions etc ...

##Usage
Coming soon ...
